# Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for FastAPI Shield, helping both users and contributors understand where the project is headed.

## Current Status

FastAPI Shield is currently in its early stages of development. The core functionality is stable, but there are many enhancements and features planned for future releases.

## Version 0.2.0 (Next Release)

### High Priority

- **Enhanced Type Handling**
  - Support for more complex type annotations
  - Better error messages for type validation failures
  - Improved generics support

- **Expanded Integration**
  - Deeper integration with Pydantic v2
  - Better support for FastAPI's dependency system

- **Documentation Improvements**
  - Add more examples in the documentation
  - Improve API reference documentation

### Medium Priority

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Reduce overhead for shield validation
  - Optimize interceptor chain execution

- **Testing Enhancements**
  - Expand test coverage
  - Add more integration tests with real-world scenarios

## Version 0.3.0

### High Priority

- **Cache System**
  - Implement a caching system for validation results
  - Add configurable cache strategies

- **Aspect-Oriented Programming**
  - Provide a more comprehensive AOP implementation
  - Enable aspect composition and inheritance

- **Annotation Plugins**
  - Support for custom annotations that modify shield behavior
  - Plugin system for extending shield capabilities

### Medium Priority

- **Shield Factories**
  - More factory patterns for shield creation
  - Conditional shield generation based on context

- **Security Hardening**
  - Enhanced protection against common security vulnerabilities
  - Input sanitization and validation utilities

### Low Priority

- **Admin Interface**
  - Optional admin dashboard for monitoring shield usage
  - Visual configuration of shields

## Future Vision (1.0 and beyond)

### Core Capabilities

- **Full Static Analysis Support**
  - Deeper integration with static type checkers
  - Custom plugins for mypy, pyright, etc.

- **Framework Agnostic**
  - Make core shield functionality usable outside of FastAPI
  - Adapters for other web frameworks

- **Machine Learning Integration**
  - Anomaly detection in API usage patterns
  - ML-powered input validation

### Ecosystem

- **Shield Library**
  - Collection of pre-built shields for common use cases
  - Community-contributed shield repository

- **Enterprise Features**
  - Advanced authentication and authorization patterns
  - Rate limiting and quota management
  - Compliance with security standards (OWASP, GDPR, etc.)

- **IDE Support**
  - Better syntax highlighting and autocomplete for shields
  - Custom LSP for shield development

## How to Contribute to the Roadmap

We welcome community input on our roadmap. If you have suggestions or would like to help implement any of these features:

1. **Open an Issue**: Share your ideas on GitHub issues
2. **Start a Discussion**: Propose major features or changes through discussions
3. **Submit a PR**: Implement features or improvements aligned with the roadmap

## Prioritization Criteria

Features are prioritized based on:

1. **User Impact**: How many users will benefit from the feature
2. **Strategic Alignment**: How well it aligns with project goals
3. **Implementation Complexity**: Effort required vs. benefit
4. **Community Interest**: Level of interest from the community

## Release Schedule

- **Minor Releases**: Every 2-3 months
- **Patch Releases**: As needed for bug fixes
- **Major Releases**: When significant changes or features are ready

## Breaking Changes

We follow these principles for breaking changes:

1. Minimize breaking changes whenever possible
2. Provide clear migration paths when breaking changes are necessary
3. Follow semver principles strictly
4. Use deprecation warnings before removing features

## Experimental Features

Some features may be released as experimental before being finalized:

1. Experimental features will be clearly marked
2. APIs for experimental features may change between minor versions
3. Feedback is actively solicited for experimental features

## Long-term Support

Once FastAPI Shield reaches 1.0:

1. We will establish a long-term support (LTS) policy
2. Major versions will receive security updates for at least 18 months
3. Deprecation notices will be given well in advance
