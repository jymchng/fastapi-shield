# Ticket 0022: Database Connection Shield

## Context
Database connections are expensive resources that need careful management. A database shield would handle connection pooling and health checks.

## Goals
- Implement database connection management
- Connection pooling optimization
- Health check integration
- Query timeout and retry logic

## Requirements
- Connection pool management
- Database health monitoring
- Query timeout enforcement
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Support for multiple database types

## Acceptance Criteria
- DatabaseConnectionShield with pool management
- Health check integration
- Timeout and retry mechanisms
- Tests with database mocking
- Performance optimization
