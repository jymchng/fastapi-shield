# Ticket 0020: Request Tracing Shield

## Context
Distributed tracing is essential for debugging and monitoring. A tracing shield would add tracing capabilities to shielded endpoints.

## Goals
- Implement distributed tracing support
- Integration with popular tracing systems
- Custom span creation and annotation
- Performance monitoring

## Requirements
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Support for Jaeger, Zipkin, DataDog
- Custom span creation with shield context
- Performance metrics collection
- Trace ID propagation across shields

## Acceptance Criteria
- RequestTracingShield with OpenTelemetry support
- Multiple tracing backend integration
- Custom span and metric creation
- Tests with mock tracing systems
- Performance impact assessment
