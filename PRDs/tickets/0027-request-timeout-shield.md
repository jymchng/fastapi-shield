# Ticket 0027: Request Timeout Shield

## Context
Request timeouts prevent resource exhaustion from slow clients and long-running requests. A timeout shield would enforce configurable time limits.

## Goals
- Implement configurable request timeouts
- Different timeouts for different endpoints
- Graceful timeout handling
- Integration with async request processing

## Requirements
- Configurable timeout per endpoint or shield
- Graceful connection termination on timeout
- Timeout metrics and logging
- Integration with async frameworks
- Client notification of timeout

## Acceptance Criteria
- RequestTimeoutShield with flexible configuration
- Graceful timeout handling
- Comprehensive timeout metrics
- Tests with slow request simulation
- Performance impact assessment
