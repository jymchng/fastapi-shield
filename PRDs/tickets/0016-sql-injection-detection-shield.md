## Requirements
- Pattern-based SQL injection detection
- Configurable sensitivity levels
- Logging and alerting for detected attempts
- Support for various SQL dialects
- Performance optimization for pattern matching

## Acceptance Criteria
- SQLInjectionDetectionShield with pattern library
- Configurable detection sensitivity
- Comprehensive logging and alerting
- Tests with SQL injection payloads
- Performance benchmarks
