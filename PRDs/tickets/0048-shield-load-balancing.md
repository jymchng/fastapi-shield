# Ticket 0048: Shield Load Balancing

## Context
Load balancing shields could distribute requests across multiple backends or services based on various algorithms and health checks.

## Goals
- Implement load balancing capabilities
- Multiple load balancing algorithms
- Health check integration
- Failover mechanisms

## Requirements
- Round-robin, weighted, and least-connections algorithms
- Backend health monitoring
- Automatic failover and recovery
- Sticky sessions support
- Performance metrics and monitoring

## Acceptance Criteria
- Load balancing shield implementation
- Multiple algorithm support
- Health check and failover
- Tests with backend simulation
- Performance and reliability metrics
