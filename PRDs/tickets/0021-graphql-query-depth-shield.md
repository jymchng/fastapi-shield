# Ticket 0021: GraphQL Query Depth Shield

## Context
GraphQL endpoints can be vulnerable to deep query attacks that cause resource exhaustion. A query depth shield would limit query complexity.

## Goals
- Implement GraphQL query depth analysis
- Configurable depth and complexity limits
- Query cost calculation and limiting
- Integration with GraphQL parsers

## Requirements
- GraphQL query parsing and analysis
- Configurable depth and complexity limits
- Query cost calculation algorithms
- Integration with popular GraphQL libraries
- Performance optimization for query analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
- GraphQLQueryDepthShield with configurable limits
- Query cost calculation mechanisms
- Integration with GraphQL ecosystem
- Tests with complex GraphQL queries
- Performance benchmarks
