# Ticket 0013: Request Size Limit Shield

## Context
Large request payloads can be used for DoS attacks and resource exhaustion. A request size limiting shield would prevent such attacks.

## Goals
- Implement configurable request size limits
- Different limits for different content types
- Early request rejection to save resources
- Integration with existing error handling

## Requirements
- Configurable size limits per endpoint
- Different limits for JSON, form data, files
- Early size validation before parsing
- Proper error responses with size information
- Memory usage optimization

## Acceptance Criteria
- RequestSizeLimitShield with flexible configuration
- Early size validation mechanisms
- Memory-efficient implementation
- Tests with large payloads
- Performance benchmarks
