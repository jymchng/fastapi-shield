# Ticket 0031: Shield Composition Optimizer

## Context
When multiple shields are composed, there might be redundant operations or optimization opportunities. An optimizer would improve shield chain performance.

## Goals
- Analyze shield composition chains
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Reduce redundant operations
- Improve overall performance

## Requirements
- Static analysis of shield chains
- Redundancy detection and elimination
- Performance profiling integration
- Automatic optimization suggestions
- Configurable optimization levels

## Acceptance Criteria
- Shield composition analysis tools
- Optimization recommendation engine
- Performance improvement metrics
- Tests with complex shield chains
- Documentation for optimization patterns
