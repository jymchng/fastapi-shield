# Ticket 0055: Enterprise Security Orchestration and Response (SOAR) Platform

## Context
Enterprise organizations need a unified security orchestration platform that integrates all FastAPI-Shield components into a cohesive security operations center. This system should provide centralized management, automated incident response, and comprehensive security orchestration across all deployed shields.

## Goals
- Unified security orchestration platform integrating all FastAPI-Shield components
- Automated incident response with customizable playbooks and workflows
- Real-time security operations center (SOC) with live monitoring and alerting
- Advanced threat correlation and analysis across multiple security layers
- Enterprise-grade reporting and compliance management
- Scalable architecture supporting multi-tenant deployments

## Requirements

### Core SOAR Platform
- **SecurityOrchestrator**: Main orchestration engine coordinating all security components
- **IncidentManager**: Advanced incident detection, tracking, and automated response
- **PlaybookEngine**: Customizable security playbooks with automated workflows
- **ThreatCorrelationEngine**: Cross-component threat analysis and pattern detection
- **ComplianceManager**: Comprehensive compliance reporting and audit trails
- **MultiTenantManager**: Multi-tenant support with isolation and resource management

### Advanced Security Operations
- Real-time security event correlation across all shields
- Automated threat hunting with machine learning-based detection
- Dynamic security policy adjustment based on threat landscape
- Integrated vulnerability management and remediation
- Advanced forensics and incident reconstruction capabilities

### Enterprise Integration
- SIEM/SOAR system integration (Splunk, IBM QRadar, etc.)
- Ticketing system integration (ServiceNow, Jira, etc.)
- Email and messaging notifications (Slack, Teams, PagerDuty)
- Enterprise directory integration (Active Directory, LDAP)
- API gateway integration for centralized policy enforcement

### Monitoring and Analytics
- Real-time security operations dashboard with executive views
- Advanced analytics with threat intelligence correlation
- Predictive security analytics with risk forecasting
- Performance metrics and SLA monitoring
- Comprehensive audit trails and forensics capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria
