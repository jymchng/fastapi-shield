# Ticket 0050: Shield Machine Learning Security

## Context
Machine learning-based security features could detect anomalies, predict threats, and adapt security policies based on patterns.

## Goals
- Implement ML-based security features
- Anomaly detection for requests
- Threat prediction and prevention
- Adaptive security policies

## Requirements
- Request pattern analysis and anomaly detection
- Threat intelligence integration
- Adaptive rate limiting based on behavior
- Integration with ML frameworks (scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
- Real-time threat scoring and response

## Acceptance Criteria
- ML-based security shield
- Anomaly detection capabilities
- Threat prediction and scoring
- Tests with security scenarios
- Performance optimization for real-time ML
