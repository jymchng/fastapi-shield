# Ticket 0003: Implement Rate Limiting Shield

## Context
FastAPI Shield currently provides authentication and authorization shields but lacks built-in rate limiting capabilities. Rate limiting is a crucial security feature that prevents abuse and DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests per time window.

## Goals
- Create a `RateLimitShield` class that implements common rate limiting algorithms
- Support multiple backends (in-memory, Redis, database)
- Provide both per-IP and per-user rate limiting
- Integration with existing shield system

## Requirements
- Implement sliding window, fixed window, and token bucket algorithms
- Support configurable time windows and request limits
- Store rate limit state in memory by default, with Redis backend option
- Return proper HTTP 429 status with retry-after headers
- Thread-safe implementation for concurrent requests

## Acceptance Criteria
- RateLimitShield can be used as decorator like other shields
- Configurable limits: requests per second/minute/hour/day
- Proper error responses with rate limit information
- Tests covering different algorithms and edge cases
- Documentation with usage examples
