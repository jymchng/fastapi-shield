# Ticket 0004: Input Validation Shield

## Context
FastAPI provides built-in Pydantic validation, but sometimes additional custom validation logic is needed before reaching the endpoint. An input validation shield would allow pre-processing and validation of request data.

## Goals
- Create shields for validating and sanitizing request data
- Support custom validation rules beyond Pydantic
- Ability to transform/normalize input data
- Integration with existing validation error handling

## Requirements
- XSS prevention and input sanitization
- Custom validation rules (regex patterns, business logic)
- Data transformation capabilities (trimming, normalization)
- Support for validating headers, query params, path params, and body
- Proper error messages for validation failures

## Acceptance Criteria
- InputValidationShield with configurable validation rules
- Built-in sanitizers for common attack vectors
- Custom validator function support
- Integration with FastAPI's validation error format
- Comprehensive test coverage
