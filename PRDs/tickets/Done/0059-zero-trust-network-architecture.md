   - Application-level network controls
   - Traffic inspection and filtering
   - Encrypted tunnel management

3. **Continuous Authorization**
   - Real-time access policy evaluation
   - Risk-based access decisions
   - Contextual authorization
   - Session risk assessment

4. **Data Classification and Protection**
   - Automatic data classification
   - Data loss prevention (DLP)
   - Encryption in transit and at rest
   - Data access audit trails

### Advanced Components
1. **Zero-Trust Policy Engine**
   - Policy definition and management
   - Dynamic policy enforcement
   - Risk-based policy adaptation
   - Multi-tenant policy isolation

2. **Device Trust Management**
   - Device enrollment and lifecycle
   - Device compliance validation
   - Certificate management
   - Device behavior analysis

3. **Network Trust Broker**
   - Software-defined perimeter (SDP)
   - Secure access service edge (SASE) integration
   - VPN-less secure connectivity
   - Network access control (NAC)

4. **Analytics and Intelligence**
   - User behavior analytics (UBA)
   - Entity behavior analytics (EBA)
   - Risk scoring algorithms
   - Anomaly detection

### Integration Features
1. **Identity Provider Integration**
   - SAML 2.0 integration
   - OpenID Connect support
   - LDAP/Active Directory integration
   - Custom identity provider support

2. **Network Infrastructure Integration**
   - SDN (Software-Defined Networking) integration
   - Cloud security posture management
   - Container security integration
   - Kubernetes network policies

3. **Security Information Integration**
   - SIEM integration
   - Threat intelligence feeds
   - Security orchestration integration
   - Incident response automation

4. **Compliance and Governance**
   - Regulatory compliance monitoring
   - Access governance workflows
   - Audit trail generation
   - Compliance reporting
