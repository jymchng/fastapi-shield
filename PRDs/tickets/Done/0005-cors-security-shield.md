# Ticket 0005: CORS Security Shield

## Context
While FastAPI has CORS middleware, a shield-based approach would allow per-endpoint CORS control and more granular security policies based on authentication state.

## Goals
- Implement CORS validation at the shield level
- Allow different CORS policies for different endpoints
- Dynamic CORS policies based on authentication
- More restrictive CORS controls for sensitive endpoints

## Requirements
- Per-endpoint CORS configuration
- Dynamic allowed origins based on user authentication
- Support for preflight request handling
- Integration with existing authentication shields
- Configurable headers and methods per endpoint

## Acceptance Criteria
- CORSShield with configurable policies
- Support for dynamic origin validation
- Proper preflight response handling
- Tests for various CORS scenarios
- Documentation with security best practices
