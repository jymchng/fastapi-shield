# Ticket 0011: Circuit Breaker Shield

## Context
Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures by temporarily blocking requests when downstream services are failing. A circuit breaker shield would provide resilience patterns.

## Goals
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for shields
- Configurable failure thresholds and recovery
- Integration with health checks
- Monitoring and metrics collection

## Requirements
- States: closed, open, half-open
- Configurable failure thresholds and timeouts
- Exponential backoff for recovery attempts
- Metrics collection for monitoring
- Integration with external health check systems

## Acceptance Criteria
- CircuitBreakerShield with configurable parameters
- Proper state transitions
- Metrics and monitoring integration
- Tests for all circuit breaker states
- Performance impact assessment
