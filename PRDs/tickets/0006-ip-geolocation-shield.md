# Ticket 0006: IP Geolocation Shield

## Context
Some applications need to restrict access based on geographic location or allow/block specific IP ranges. An IP geolocation shield would provide location-based access control.

## Goals
- Implement IP-based access control
- Support for IP range blocking/allowing
- Geolocation-based restrictions
- Integration with IP reputation services

## Requirements
- CIDR range support for IP blocking/allowing
- Geolocation lookup using external services
- Country/region-based restrictions
- Support for proxy detection
- Configurable IP whitelist/blacklist

## Acceptance Criteria
- IPGeoShield with configurable IP rules
- Geolocation service integration
- Support for IPv4 and IPv6
- Tests with mock IP data
- Performance considerations for IP lookup
