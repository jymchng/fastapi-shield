# Ticket 0030: Request Replay Shield

## Context
Request replay attacks can be prevented by ensuring each request is processed only once using nonces or timestamps.

## Goals
- Implement request replay protection
- Nonce-based and timestamp-based validation
- Configurable replay windows
- Integration with distributed systems

## Requirements
- Nonce generation and validation
- Timestamp-based replay detection
- Configurable replay windows
- Distributed nonce storage (Redis)
- Performance optimization for validation

## Acceptance Criteria
- RequestReplayShield with multiple strategies
- Distributed nonce storage support
- Configurable replay protection
- Tests with replay attack scenarios
- Performance benchmarks
